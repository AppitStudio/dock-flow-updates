    <div data-sparkle-version="1.52">
        <h2>What's New in DockFlow 1.52</h2>
        <h3>Important Privacy Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Browser Profile Discovery Changes</strong> – We have disabled automatic browser profile detection to address macOS privacy warnings that some users encountered.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Profile Selection</strong> – Browser profile selection is now a manual opt-in process with full transparency about what data is accessed.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Permission Disclosure</strong> – When you choose to enable browser profile support, DockFlow provides complete information about the process and prepares you for any macOS permission requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Privacy First</strong> – DockFlow does not collect or use any sensitive browser data. The permission request exists only because we access browser profile configuration files to enable profile switching functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>macOS may display a system warning about "Sensitive Data" access when DockFlow reads browser profile files. This warning can be concerning, so we've redesigned this feature to give you complete control and transparency. You can now choose whether to enable browser profile switching with full knowledge of what's happening behind the scenes.</p>
        <p><em>Thank you for your continued support and feedback!</em></p>
    </div>

            <li><strong>Stability improvements</strong> and enhanced error handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Background processing enhancements</strong> for better system integration.</li>

    <div data-sparkle-version="1.50">
        <h2>What's New in DockFlow 1.50</h2>
        <h3>Browser Profile Selection (Beta)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Launch specific browser profiles</strong> when switching presets.</li>
            <li><strong>Supported browsers:</strong> Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave Browser, Vivaldi, Arc.</li>
            <li><strong>Why Beta?</strong> To keep DockFlow permission‑free, we use safe, non‑privileged workarounds.
                This may lead to minor quirks in some setups. We’d love your feedback to help us stabilize and expand
                this feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Safari limitation:</strong> Safari is not supported. Apple does not expose an API to control
                Safari profiles without additional permissions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Improvements & Bug Fixes</h3>
        <ul>

                anyone.</li>
